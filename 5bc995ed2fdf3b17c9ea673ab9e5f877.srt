1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,940
Hilde Dickhaut. Born October 20, 1858.

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,150
Died of exsanguination August 17, 1889.

3
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,050
No notes of interest.

4
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,080
That wraps up today's job.
Let's call it a night.

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,810
Yes.

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,410
Still, to think those two survived
and went to England.

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,490
Isn't it amazing how human history
is built on things like this?

8
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,450
You're making too big a deal of it, Sascha.
It's just two humans going to England.

9
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,910
Ah-ah-ah! That's where you're wrong, Ludger.

10
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,330
Just think: an incredibly lethal new gas
and the developer of that gas

11
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,980
are both bound for England.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,940
What a perfect way to keep Germany in check!

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,510
Ugh, here we go.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,850
They fought with swords and arrows
until just a few centuries ago,

15
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,640
but now they're making poisons
that can kill hundreds with one drop.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,830
Human progress is amazing.

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,440
What's more, there are minor geniuses
like these all over the world.

18
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,620
If just one of them upsets
the world's balance,

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,920
it might trigger a great war
that will engulf the whole globe!

20
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,750
That would be rotten.

21
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,960
Personally, I'd rather have a world war
than too much time on my hands.

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,940
And I'd wager...

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,340
...he feels the same way.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm not that kind of freak,
so I'd rather not be so busy.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,010
I quite agree.

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,610
If that happened, we'd never
get to leave work on time.

27
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,570
Hi there. You've come a long way...

28
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,660
William and Grell.

29
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,530
Too long.

30
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,150
Yoo-hoo! I've missed you to death!

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Black Butler

32
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,600
Emerald Witch Arc

33
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,360
A red coat, eh?

34
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,220
You're as flashy as ever.

35
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,550
But of course! I'm the only lady in the English
branch's Collections Department, after all!

36
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,260
Here's the handover documentation.

37
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,520
I didn't anticipate being sent
all the way to Germany on business.

38
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,490
What a nuisance. The whole world
seems primed for war these days.

39
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,900
Well, even though I'm sad
we missed Sebas-chan,

40
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,530
I had fun on this little trip
with you, Will—ouch!

41
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,080
Speaking of war, how did that affair
with the walking corpses turn out?

42
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,730
It's still under investigation.

43
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,250
I take it none have appeared
here in Germany yet.

44
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,180
Still, please contact the English branch
with any information about the deserter.

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,310
Now, if you'll excuse us.

46
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,360
Toodles!

47
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,440
Will, let's make a side trip to Baden-Baden!

48
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,980
There have always been
the occasional job deserters, I guess.

49
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,030
What do you think makes them want to run
from the Grim Reaper Staffing Association?

50
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,620
Never thought about it.

51
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,870
They might just be bored with their jobs,

52
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,430
or they might have some special reason.

53
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,170
Well, I suppose I can understand.

54
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,470
We used to be human, after all.

55
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,400
Humans who commit suicide are turned
into grim reapers as punishment,

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,900
then worked to the bone
until the day we're forgiven,

57
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,310
endlessly gazing at death like this.

58
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
It's pretty depressing for us suicides
to have to hear people

59
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,980
regretting their deaths and
thirsting for life day in and day out, huh?

60
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,070
You don't look the least bit depressed.

61
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,530
Yep, I'm having more fun now than I did
when I was alive! Maybe it's my divine calling?

62
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,770
Nothing divine about grim reapers.

63
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,140
Welcome back, sir.

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,730
You've certainly...

65
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
made a lot of mischief.

66
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,450
Heinrich, get a doctor.

67
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,700
And draw a bath, too.

68
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,450
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,040
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

70
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,920
Indeed it has, my friend!

71
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,500
Who is this?

72
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,710
This is Phantomhive's son.

73
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,460
I knew it!

74
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,690
It's an honour to meet you, Lord Phantomhive.

75
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,620
I appreciate the hospitality.

76
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,830
I can see your father in you.

77
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,150
I apologize for my appearance.

78
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,010
It's so big!

79
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,100
This is one of several castles
held by the Weizsäcker barony.

80
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm afraid it's rather small
compared to the main castle,

81
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,060
but please do make yourselves at home.

82
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,320
Small?!

83
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,300
You're a sheltered rich boy, huh?

84
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,150
Says the pot to the kettle.

85
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,730
Let's show our guests to their rooms.

86
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,990
At once.

87
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,910
Please bring the injured man this way.

88
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,980
This way, please.

89
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,020
We'll bring you fresh clothes right away.

90
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,860
Heinrich, allow us to help as well.

91
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,110
Thank you.

92
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,630
The doctor will be here soon.
Please hold on just a little longer.

93
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,340
We're here, and Wolfram seems
to have pulled through. That's a relief.

94
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,540
Yes.

95
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,560
This may sting a bit, but please bear with it.

96
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,800
Pardon me, my lord.

97
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,890
I wonder how much of this
Her Majesty anticipated.

98
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,130
Did she really send us here
to investigate the mysterious deaths?

99
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,960
Or did she expect us to find German
military secrets when she gave those orders?

100
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,330
Who knows? A queen's thoughts are
beyond a mere butler's understanding.

101
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,740
But one thing is clear:

102
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,870
Germany's toxic gas and
tank development is at a high level.

103
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,340
That, and England has also
acquired those same things.

104
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,300
I believe the future
will be very interesting.

105
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,050
All right, close your eyes.

106
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,690
Hmph. "Interesting" isn't the word.

107
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,560
Truly, humans change at dizzying speed.

108
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,540
And yet...

109
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,520
You haven't grown any taller.
Why is that, I wonder?

110
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,380
I'll take none of that from you.
You haven't changed in centuries.

111
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,470
Undertaker?

112
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,020
He was here recently.

113
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,970
What?

114
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,300
What was he doing in Germany?

115
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,970
He said he had business in France
and decided to stop by.

116
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,560
I had no idea he was involved
in the sinking of that luxury liner.

117
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,630
France?

118
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,300
Do you have any idea where he is?

119
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,370
No, I don't.

120
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,450
But...

121
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,210
I haven't seen you in a long time, Diederich.

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,470
Not since his funeral, I think.

123
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,380
You don't come to England much anymore.

124
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,430
Is that because the earl is gone?

125
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,300
Or because your body is harder to mov—

126
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,770
I couldn't hold it in!

127
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,140
What the devil are you here for?!

128
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,890
It's just that you've changed so much.

129
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,680
Humans do change in
such little time, don't they?

130
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,820
You used to be so thin.

131
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,910
Leave it out.

132
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,630
We'll probably have to
special order your coffin.

133
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,560
Shall I measure you now, just in case?

134
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,620
Not necessary.

135
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,110
The earl would probably laugh
if he could see you now.

136
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't even want to picture it.

137
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,760
He did me a favour by dying fir—

138
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,180
Poor thing. Burned down to his bones.

139
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,940
No coming back from a death like that.

140
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,570
Oh, but...

141
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,530
There's still the other
Earl Phantomhive, after all.

142
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,950
He said "the other"?

143
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,040
I paid it no mind at the time,
since he always talks nonsense, but...

144
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,890
Did he mean me?

145
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,550
Or...

146
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,610
Sir, dinner is ready. Shall I bring it in here?

147
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,910
No, we'll move to the dining room.

148
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,530
What will you lot do next?

149
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,510
My job will be done once
I've handed Sullivan over to the Queen.

150
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,090
We'll return to England as soon
as the injured man can move.

151
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,090
Ah, Ciel!

152
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,070
I started without you,
and everything is delicious.

153
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,310
You should hurry up and eat, too.

154
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,470
Seconds, please!

155
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,760
R-Right away, yes!

156
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,040
I fear she's not quite ready
for tea with the Queen, my lord.

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm well aware.

158
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,440
Then, we'll have to make sure she's strictly
trained in ladylike manners once we get home.

159
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,620
I look forward to the challenge.

160
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,780
I'll entrust you with the task.

161
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,210
Her Majesty is eagerly waiting,
so make short work of it.

162
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,380
Very good.

163
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,510
His resilience is truly marvellous.

164
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,410
He's strong. He'll be up and about in no time.

165
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,070
Your name is Sebastian, yes?

166
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,400
Why did you save me?

167
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,570
My young master ordered me to.

168
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,290
It was very irresponsible of you
to decide your work was done,

169
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,130
and leave us to mind her.

170
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,720
Y-Young mistress, I...

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,090
Say no more.

172
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,800
I betrayed you first.

173
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,560
That night, I jumped at their promise
to show me the outside world,

174
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,360
and I decided to leave the forest.

175
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,670
I let my desires take over,
and I was going to abandon you all.

176
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,890
But you protected me anyway.

177
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,630
Yes, I'm angry with you
for deceiving me all this time.

178
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,700
But I did something cruel, too.

179
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,500
So...

180
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,930
Let's say we're even.

181
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,820
Young mistress...

182
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,390
You... forgive me?

183
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,400
Does this mean I can remain your butler?

184
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,270
Yes. Let's stay together forever.

185
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,800
Let's see the outside world
together, Wolfram.

186
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,520
Ja.

187
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,780
They suit you!

188
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,600
Just bear with it until we get to England, yes.

189
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,210
We owe you, Diederich.

190
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,030
You certainly do. Like father, like son.

191
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,070
Next time, don't bring trouble to my door.

192
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,530
"Next time"? So we're welcome to come again?

193
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,040
D-Don't look at me like that.

194
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,750
And don't come back. Good riddance to you.

195
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,570
Junior.

196
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,680
The times are about to change radically.

197
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,050
Be careful.

198
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,510
Same to you.

199
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,360
So this is London!

200
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,160
This is the capital of the land where
"the sun never sets," ruled by Queen Victoria.

201
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,780
Oi, you two.

202
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,120
German is too conspicuous in Great Britain.
Please speak English from now on.

203
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,450
Right.

204
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,080
What?

205
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,710
The young mistress may manage,
but I can hardly speak a word!

206
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,340
Then, as much as possible, please.

207
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,620
I'll give you close instruction
once we're back at the manor.

208
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,570
I imagine the Queen is impatient to see her.

209
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,070
I'd like to introduce them in a week.

210
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,750
A week? Isn't that a bit too soon?

211
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,340
I know you can get her to pass muster
by then. I'll leave the methods to you.

212
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,860
Look! What's that?

213
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,230
This is an order, Sebastian:

214
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,930
Turn this unruly girl
into a lady within one week.

215
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
Yes, my lord.

216
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,880
First things first: her attire.

217
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,880
See you soon!

218
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,930
Presentations to Her Majesty
have a strict dress code.

219
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,490
Let's commission her full court dress.

220
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,880
Hello.

221
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Welcome to Hopkins.

222
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,880
Their poses get no less strange.

223
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,910
It's good to see you again.
We'd like to order several items.

224
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:51,060
I sense a beautiful boy has entered!
Meg, Augusta, who is it?

225
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,310
You have keen senses, Miss Hopkins.

226
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,400
Oh!

227
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Goodness, my lord. How good it is to see you!

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,090
You so rarely come to my establishment!

229
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,200
I always admire the thoroughness
with which you ignore me.

230
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,620
And who might this lady be, my lord?

231
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,510
A guest. I'll be taking her in for a while.

232
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,460
Her wardrobe is bare, so I'd like
some dresses for her. Off the rail is fine.

233
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:22,070
Ah, yes, I can see this dress
isn't made of proper summer fabric.

234
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:27,010
And these colours are much too plain.
To say nothing of the poor workmanship.

235
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,520
A stuffy, outdated man who thinks "women should
be ladylike" clearly foisted his tastes on you.

236
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,450
I was coping with a crisis.

237
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,240
Pardon?

238
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,280
These two need to be outfitted for
her presentation to the Queen at a Drawing Room.

239
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,710
Ordinarily, we would order the lady's
full court dress from a couturiere,

240
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,250
but may I venture to ask you
for her costume along with his?

241
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,960
A ridiculous question.

242
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,600
A debutante's presentation...
Cheeks rosy with nervous excitement...

243
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,220
It's good. Too good!

244
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,510
I have it! The fount of
my imagination is overflowing!

245
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,660
The rules state that a presentation dress
should be pristine white.

246
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,510
She'll need a long silk petticoat
with plenty of lace.

247
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,370
Perhaps embroidered satin for the train?

248
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,230
We'll make her hair look festive
with feathers and a veil.

249
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,650
And an emerald or diamond accessory
would be just the thing!

250
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,220
Right! Step this way, please.

251
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,450
Meg, Augusta, take that one's measurements.

252
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,570
She remains very...

253
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,860
...true to herself.

254
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,780
Sorry about the mess, dear.

255
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm working on a large order
for a choir right now.

256
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,840
Now, what colours shall I pick
for your everyday dresses?

257
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,990
I have plenty of things to hand.

258
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,160
I'd like to ask a favour.

259
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,790
That should take care of the attire.

260
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,610
A lady being presented must have
her hair coiffed as befits the upper class.

261
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,670
Fortunately, Fräulein Sullivan already has
nice long hair, so it shouldn't be an issue.

262
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,840
Next up—

263
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,100
Here I am.

264
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,750
Young mistress?!

265
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,390
Ciel, you're finally home.

266
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,480
I look forward to this!
